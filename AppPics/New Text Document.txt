A Spring Boot application built using Spring MVC, Spring Security, and JDBC UserDetailsManager for user authentication and authorization. The app allows users to register, log in, and manage their favorite cars by adding detailed attributes such as make, model, horsepower, year, and purchase date. Users can upload, edit, and delete associated documents like catalogs or maintenance records. It features search and sorting capabilities for vehicles and documents, along with profile management and account deletion. The application uses JSP for the front end, Hibernate for ORM, and JPQL for efficient database interactions.
